These truths provide clarity in a chaotic world and call believers to live with purpose and confidence in God’s sovereignty.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">The Reliability of God’s Word</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The first truth is that the Bible’s prophetic accuracy proves its divine origin. God, who exists outside time, knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10). Scripture is filled with prophecies fulfilled with stunning precision, validating its trustworthiness. For example, the Old Testament predicted Israel’s scattering among the nations (Deuteronomy 28) and their miraculous regathering (Ezekiel 36). The reestablishment of Israel in 1948, after nearly two millennia of exile, is a remarkable fulfillment of these promises. Similarly, Messianic prophecies, such as Micah 5:2 naming Bethlehem as the Messiah’s birthplace, were fulfilled in Jesus with exact detail. These examples demonstrate that God’s Word is infallible—when He speaks, it happens.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">Prophecy in Action</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The second truth is that God’s prophetic timeline is actively progressing. The Bible’s end-time prophecies, once seemingly distant, are coming into focus in our world. Daniel’s visions of global empires and Revelation’s descriptions of a one-world system align with modern developments—globalization, technological advancements, and moral decline mirror these predictions. Events like wars, economic instability, and the rise of false ideologies serve as signs of the approaching end times. Israel’s restoration is a pivotal marker, setting the stage for events like the rapture and tribulation. These developments are not random but part of God’s sovereign plan, moving history toward Christ’s return.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">Prophecy’s Purpose</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Prophecy isn’t just about foretelling events; it’s a call to faith and action. Knowing God’s Word is true gives believers confidence in His promises. The rapture, when Christ will call His church to Himself (1 Thessalonians 4:17), is imminent, followed by the tribulation and Christ’s second coming. These events are certain because God’s Word has never failed. The article urges Christians to study prophecy, not to speculate about dates, but to understand God’s plan and live accordingly. This means pursuing holiness, sharing the gospel, and trusting in God’s sovereignty, even amidst global chaos.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">Countering Skepticism</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The article addresses skepticism about prophecy, noting that some dismiss it as vague or irrelevant. Yet, the Bible’s track record—hundreds of fulfilled prophecies—silences doubt. For instance, the precise fulfillment of prophecies about Israel’s return or Jesus’ life counters claims that Scripture is unreliable. Believers are called to be watchmen, recognizing the signs of the times and preparing others for what’s coming. The urgency of the hour demands boldness in proclaiming Christ, as the window for repentance is closing.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">Hope in God’s Plan</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Prophecy also offers hope. It assures believers of Christ’s ultimate victory over evil, bringing eternal peace. The article emphasizes that the unfolding of God’s plan is a reason to rejoice, not fear. The rapture will deliver believers from the coming tribulation, and Christ’s return will establish His kingdom. This certainty fuels confidence, encouraging Christians to live with purpose and expectation. The signs around us—global unrest, technological leaps, and moral shifts—are reminders that God is in control, orchestrating history toward His promised end.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">Living with Purpose</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The article calls believers to live with eternity in view, undeterred by a world that mocks their faith. Christians should remain steadfast, rooted in prayer and active in God’s mission. Studying prophecy equips believers to understand the times and share the gospel effectively. The reliability of Scripture and the unfolding of God’s plan are not abstract concepts but practical motivations for holy living and bold witness. The article urges Christians to dive into the Bible, align their lives with its truth, and shine as lights in a darkening world.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">A Call to Action</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The urgency of the times demands action. Believers are called to be vigilant, watching for the signs and preparing their hearts for Christ’s return. This involves not only personal holiness but also sharing the hope of salvation with others. The article encourages Christians to study Scripture diligently, focusing on prophecies that reveal God’s plan. By doing so, believers can stand firm, confident in God’s promises, and proclaim the gospel with urgency. The world may be chaotic, but God’s Word remains a steady anchor.</p>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">In conclusion, the two fundamental truths of prophecy—God’s reliable Word and His unfolding plan—offer hope and purpose. The Bible’s fulfilled prophecies and the signs of the times point to Christ’s imminent return. Believers are urged to live ready, sharing the gospel and trusting in God’s sovereignty. The rapture is near, and Christ’s victory is certain. Let’s embrace these truths, live with purpose, and shine God’s light until Jesus comes.</p>\n</article>",
