  "content": "<article>\n  <header>\n    <h1>What’s Contained in the Old Is Explained in the New</h1>\n    <p><em>By Jack Kelley — Reimagined for Inspiration</em></p>\n  </header>\n\n  <section>\n    <p>I once heard two simple phrases that changed how I read the Bible: <strong>“What’s contained in the Old is explained in the New.”</strong> and <strong>“What’s concealed in the Old is revealed in the New.”</strong> They taught me that the Bible is not two separate books but <em>one</em> divine story—woven together, covenant to covenant.</p>\n\n    <p>Think of the Old Testament as the stage and the New as the curtain being pulled back. The background gives meaning to the fulfillment; the fulfillment brings the promise into focus. The more we know the first part, the more brilliantly the second part shines.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h2>Two Halves of the Same Story</h2>\n    <p>Many people have read only one half of this book. The Jewish reader often knows the promise and the prophecies but misses some of their explanation. The Gentile Christian often knows the Person—Jesus—but may miss the powerful background that proves the promise. It’s like two people reading opposite halves of a mystery: one knows what happened, the other knows who did it. When they read the whole story, everything makes sense.</p>\n\n    <p>When a Jewish reader sees Jesus in Isaiah or the psalms, Scripture awakens. When a Gentile discovers those words were written centuries earlier, faith becomes anchored in reason and evidence—no longer blind hope but a rooted, rational trust.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h2>My Own Wake-Up Call</h2>\n    <p>For nearly forty years I attended church faithfully—choir, Sunday school, holidays—yet my faith was more habit than understanding. Then tapes on Old Testament prophecy opened my eyes. Over <strong>300 specific prophecies</strong> were recorded centuries before Christ and fulfilled in His life. The statistical and historical weight of that fulfillment changed everything for me: Jesus had to be the Messiah.</p>\n\n    <p>At that moment the Bible became not merely an ancient book but the <strong>very Word of God</strong>, demonstrated by prophecy fulfilled without fail.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h2>God’s Proof to the World</h2>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“Remember the former things, those of long ago... I make known the end from the beginning… My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” — Isaiah 46:9-10</p>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>No other sacred writing claims this and then proves it. Reading the whole book strengthened my faith so that liberal theology, trendy fads, and shallow zeal could no longer sway me. Knowledge and devotion finally met.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h2>Truth vs. Speculation</h2>\n    <p>A friend once told me about a TV special claiming Jesus was married or had a troubled relationship with His father. I told her, gently: opinions are fine, but they aren’t facts. I stand on an unbroken record of prophetic fulfillment—thousands of precise fulfillments stretching across history. That evidence is not speculation; it points to a divine Author.</p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“I am the Lord; that is my name!... See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.” — Isaiah 42:8-9</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </section>\n\n  <footer>\n    <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Don’t read only half the book. When promise meets Person—when the Old is read through the lens of the New—faith becomes unshakable. The whole Bible tells one story, and its Author is still writing yours.</p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n\n<p><!-- Thumbnail linked: image (47).jpeg --></p>",
