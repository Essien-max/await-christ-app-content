They often quote His words, saying He would come \"like a thief in the night\" (Matthew 24:42-44). But did you know that Paul says something quite different to believers?</p>\n\n<h2>NOT IN DARKNESS</h2>\n<p>In 1 Thessalonians 5:1-6, Paul tells us, “But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief… for you are all children of the light and of the day.” That means while the world sleeps, those in Christ can be alert. We may not know the exact day or hour — but we can recognize the season.</p>\n\n<h2>GOD'S CHARACTER: ALWAYS WARNING FIRST</h2>\n<p>God never pours out wrath without warning. He gave Noah 120 years to preach. He warned Sodom through Abraham. He sent Jonah to Nineveh, and later Nahum. Today, He’s warning the world again: Jesus is returning soon — not as a lamb, but as a Lion to judge and reign (Revelation 19:11).</p>\n\n<h2>TO THE UNBELIEVER AND THE CHURCH</h2>\n<p>If you're not saved, the message is urgent: Flee from the coming wrath by running into the arms of Jesus. But this is also for believers. Romans 13:12 says, “The night is nearly over; the day is almost here.” This is a call to holiness and urgency.</p>\n\n<h2>THE PROPHETIC SIGNS ARE EVERYWHERE</h2>\n<p>The Bible is full of prophecies. One in every 25 New Testament verses is about Jesus’ return. Let’s walk through the major signs that show we’re living in the season of His coming.</p>\n\n<h2>NATURE GROANS</h2>\n<p>Jesus said to expect earthquakes, famines, and pestilences. Like birth pains, they would increase in frequency and intensity (Matthew 24:7-8). We’re seeing that today — more natural disasters, more intense storms, and environmental chaos.</p>\n\n<h2>SOCIETY BREAKS DOWN</h2>\n<p>Just as in the days of Noah, sin is celebrated today. Paul said people would love themselves, money, and pleasure rather than God (2 Timothy 3:1-5). What used to be shameful is now honored.</p>\n\n<h2>SPIRITUAL CONFUSION AND REVIVAL</h2>\n<p>There’s a rise in false teachings, occult practices, and spiritual deception. But also — the Gospel is being preached globally, and many are turning to Christ. The Holy Spirit is still moving powerfully.</p>\n\n<h2>TECHNOLOGY ALIGNS WITH PROPHECY</h2>\n<p>Prophecies once unimaginable are now possible. Satellite TV makes global events instantly visible (Revelation 11). Digital IDs and biometric tech make the mark of the Beast (Revelation 13) more realistic than ever.</p>\n\n<h2>THE GLOBAL POLITICAL LANDSCAPE</h2>\n<p>Israel has returned to the world stage. Russia looms from the north. China rises in power. The European Union fits the prophecy of a revived Roman Empire. All of it aligns with Scripture.</p>\n\n<h2>THE MIRACLE OF ISRAEL</h2>\n<p>In 1948, Israel became a nation — just as Jesus prophesied using the fig tree (Matthew 24:32-34). Then in 1967, Jerusalem returned to Jewish control (Luke 21:24). These are key time markers. We are that generation.</p>\n\n<h2>A FINAL CHALLENGE</h2>\n<p>The signs are not subtle. They’re shouting at us. The King is at the door. If He returned today, would you be ready?</p>\n\n<p>Jesus is either your <strong>Blessed Hope</strong> (Titus 2:13) or your <strong>Holy Terror</strong> (Revelation 6:15-17). There’s no in-between. Turn to Him now. And if you already belong to Him — live like it.</p>\n\n<p>Can you say, like Paul, “I have loved His appearing” (2 Timothy 4:8)?</p>"
