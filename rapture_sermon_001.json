But here’s what most overlook: Jesus was not talking to believers when He gave that warning.\n\nThe apostle Paul clears up the confusion in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, writing to the church:\n\n> “But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that this day should surprise you like a thief.”\n\nWhy not? Because true believers have the Holy Spirit living in them — the Spirit who opens our eyes to understand Scripture and recognize the season of His return. No, we don’t know the exact day or hour. But we’re not meant to be clueless. We’re meant to be awake.\n\n---\n\n**God's Character Demands a Warning**\n\nGod never pours out judgment without warning first. It’s part of His nature.\n\nHe warned the people of Noah’s time — for 120 years. He warned Sodom through Abraham. He sent Jonah to Nineveh and Nahum later. Why? Because as 2 Peter 3:9 says, “God is not willing that any should perish.”\n\nHe is patient. But His patience is not forever.\n\nRight now, that same God is once again warning the world. He’s calling people to repentance. And He’s doing it because His Son is coming — not as a suffering servant this time, but as a conquering King.\n\n---\n\n**Two Messages — One for Unbelievers, One for the Church**\n\nFor the unbeliever:\n> “Flee from the wrath to come by running into the arms of Jesus today.”\n\nFor the believer:\n> “The night is almost gone; the day is at hand. So let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.” — Romans 13:12\n\nThis is not the time for lukewarm faith. Not the time for spiritual laziness. If there was ever a time to take your walk seriously — it’s now.\n\n---\n\n**The Six Great Signposts of Jesus’ Return**\n\nThe Bible doesn’t leave us guessing. It gives us sign after sign to know when the time is near. These aren’t vague. They’re specific — and many have already happened or are happening right now. Let’s walk through the six main categories of signs, like markers on a road pointing straight to the return of Christ.\n\n1. **Nature’s Voice Is Getting Louder**\nJesus told us in Matthew 24:7 and Luke 21:11 to expect more earthquakes, famines, plagues, and strange signs in the skies.\n\nThese things have always happened. But Jesus said they would increase — like birth pains. Stronger. Closer together. More intense.\n\nFrom floods and wildfires to deadly viruses and massive storms, creation itself seems to be groaning — just as Romans 8:22 said it would.\n\nAnd all throughout Scripture, God has used natural events to get people’s attention. He did it in Noah’s day. In Egypt. Through the prophets. Even at the crucifixion of Jesus. And He’s doing it again.\n\n2. **Society Is Spiraling**\nJesus said it will be like the days of Noah — godless, immoral, and indifferent.\n\nPaul, in 2 Timothy 3, takes it further:\nPeople will love only themselves.\nThey’ll love money.\nThey’ll chase pleasure.\nThey’ll despise truth.\nThey'll act religious, but reject real power.\n\nWe’re watching this happen daily — globally.\n\n3. **The Spiritual Landscape Is Split in Two**\nTwo movements are rising side by
