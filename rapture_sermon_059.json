This doctrine, often called \"eternal security,\" rests on the unchanging nature of God’s promises and the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice. To understand this, we must first clarify what salvation entails. It is not a singular moment but a threefold reality: justification, sanctification, and glorification. Justification delivers us from the penalty of sin, sanctification frees us from its power, and glorification will one day liberate us from its presence. This divine progression underscores that salvation is God’s work, not ours.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">The Nature of Salvation</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">When we place our faith in Jesus, we are justified—saved from sin’s penalty through His atoning death (Ephesians 2:8-9). This is a completed act, unalterable by our flaws. Sanctification, the ongoing process of growing in holiness, is empowered by the Holy Spirit, who works within us moment by moment (Romans 6). Finally, glorification awaits, when our bodies will be redeemed, free from sin’s stain (Romans 8:23). These truths affirm that salvation is not a fragile gift we must cling to but a divine promise secured by God’s power.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">Scriptural Assurances</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Scripture abounds with assurances of this security. John 6:39 declares that Jesus will lose none of those given to Him by the Father, raising them up on the last day. John 10:28-29 echoes this, promising that no one can snatch Christ’s sheep from His hand or the Father’s. Romans 8:38-39 further assures that nothing—neither death, life, nor any created thing—can separate us from God’s love. These verses paint a picture of a salvation not contingent on human effort but anchored in God’s unwavering commitment.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">Addressing Objections</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Yet, some argue that believers can lose their salvation, citing warnings against falling away. These warnings, however, often address those who profess faith without genuine conversion. True believers, sealed by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13-14), are preserved by God’s power, not their own. The Arminian view, which suggests salvation can be forfeited, implies that human sinfulness could overpower divine grace—a notion contrary to Scripture’s depiction of God’s sovereignty. Conversely, the Calvinist perspective holds that those who fall away were never truly saved, aligning with 1 John 2:19, which notes that those who depart were never truly of the faith.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">Balancing Assurance and Responsibility</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">An alternative view, sometimes called the “Partaker” position, suggests that believers are secure but may face discipline or loss of rewards for unfaithfulness (1 Corinthians 3:11-15). This view balances the assurance of salvation with the call to holy living, recognizing that while salvation is secure, our fellowship with God can be strained by sin. Yet, even this strain does not undo the family bond established at salvation, much like a child remains part of a family despite broken fellowship.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">The Foundation of God’s Love</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The beauty of eternal security lies in its foundation: God’s electing love. He chose to save us, knowing our total depravity, and His grace does not waver when we stumble (Romans 11:29). Jesus, our High Priest, intercedes for us, ensuring our place in eternity (John 17:11-12). To doubt this security is to question the sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice and the reliability of God’s promises. Instead, we are called to rest in the certainty that our salvation, from beginning to end, is God’s work—a gift of grace that endures forever.</p>\n</article>",
