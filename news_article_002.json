We cling to Your promise that our Lord Jesus Christ will return in glory, just as He said. Lord, ignite our hearts with holy anticipation for that blessed day. Let our lamps be filled with oil, our spirits awake, and our lives consecrated to You.</p>\n<p>Strengthen us, O God, as we wait—not in fear, but in joyful expectation. Let our trials remind us that this world is not our home. Set our minds on things above, where Christ is seated at Your right hand. Help us to endure, to remain faithful, and to shine as lights in the darkness until You appear in the clouds to take us home.</p>\n<p>Even so, come, Lord Jesus. We are watching. We are waiting. And our hope is unshakable.</p>\n<p><strong>In Jesus' mighty name, Amen.</strong></p>",
