The Bible calls it the Book of Life, and it’s not just a poetic idea—it’s God’s eternal record of those who’ve said “yes” to Jesus. Revelation 20:12–15 paints a vivid scene: at the end of time, the books are opened, and those whose names are written in the Book of Life step into God’s presence. Want to know how to get your name on that list? Let’s dive into the ultimate VIP pass to eternity.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">What Is the Book of Life?</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The Book of Life isn’t your average signup sheet. It’s the divine ledger where God records the names of those who’ve trusted in Jesus Christ as their Savior. Revelation 20:15 is stark: if your name isn’t in this book, you face an eternity apart from God. But here’s the good news—getting your name written is simpler than you might think. It’s not about earning a spot with perfect behavior; it’s about accepting the gift of salvation through faith in Jesus, who paid the price for your sins.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">Secured by Faith</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">John 10:28–29 offers a rock-solid promise: those who believe in Jesus are held securely in God’s hand, and no one can snatch them away. This is the heart of eternal security—once you trust Jesus, your name is inked in the Book of Life, and it’s permanent. This isn’t about a temporary guest pass; it’s a lifelong, eternal reservation. Your faith in Christ locks in your spot, ensuring you’re part of God’s forever family.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">Can Names Be Erased?</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Some might wonder if names can be blotted out of the Book of Life, pointing to verses like Exodus 32:33, where God warns that sinners could be removed. But Revelation 3:5 brings clarity: those who overcome through faith in Jesus are secure, their names never erased. This isn’t about God dangling salvation like a carrot only to yank it away. It’s about His unshakeable promise to those who trust Him. Your faith seals the deal, and God’s faithfulness keeps it locked.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: var(--subheading-color); margin-top: 20px;\">God’s Foreknowledge, Your Choice</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The Book of Life raises big questions about free will and God’s sovereignty. Does God predetermine who’s in the book, or do you have a say? The Bible strikes a beautiful balance: God knows who’ll accept His invitation, but you’re free to choose. Romans 10:13 declares that “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” Your decision to trust Jesus writes your name in the book, harmonizing God’s foreknowledge with your freedom. It’s like an RSVP to the ultimate banquet—you’re invited, but you’ve got to respond.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">The Stakes of Exclusion</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The flip side is sobering. Revelation 20:15 warns that those not found in the Book of Life face eternal separation from God. This isn’t about scare tactics; it’s about the reality of rejecting the One who offers life. Choosing to ignore Jesus doesn’t just mean missing out on a party—it means missing out on God’s presence forever. The good news? You don’t have to face that fate. The door to salvation is open, and faith in Jesus is the key.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">Living with Eternal Confidence</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">Knowing your name is in the Book of Life changes how you live. It’s like having a backstage pass to the greatest event in history—you can walk through life with joy, not fear. John 5:24 assures believers they’ve already passed from death to life. This security isn’t a license to coast but a call to live boldly, sharing the gospel and reflecting Christ’s love. Your place in eternity is set, freeing you to shine as a light in a world of uncertainty.</p>\n  <h2 style=\"font-size: 20px; color: #34495e; margin-top: 20px;\">Your Invitation Awaits</h2>\n  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">The Book of Life isn’t a distant dream—it’s a reality you can claim today. Trusting Jesus writes your name in God’s eternal record, securing your place in His kingdom. Picture it: your name, glowing in divine ink, a testament to His grace. The alternative is a choice to reject Him, but why settle for that? The invitation is universal, the gift is free, and the moment is now. Say “yes” to Jesus, and claim your eternal reservation in the greatest story ever told.</p>\n</article>",
