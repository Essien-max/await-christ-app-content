The Nature of God</h3>\n    <p>There is one God, the Creator of all things, perfect, infinite, and eternal in all His ways. He exists in three distinct yet co-equal Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Deut. 6:4; Gen. 1:1; John 6:27; Heb. 1:8; Acts 5:3,4; 2 Cor. 13:14</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>2. Jesus Christ</h3>\n    <p>Jesus Christ is both true God and true Man. Conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, He lived a sinless life, offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for sin through His death on the cross, was buried, and rose bodily on the third day. He ascended into Heaven, where He now sits at the right hand of God the Father as our High Priest and Advocate.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> John 1:1; Phil. 2:5-8; Luke 1:30-35; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Cor. 15:3,4; Heb. 7:25; 1 John 2:1</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>3. The Holy Spirit</h3>\n    <p>The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Trinity, whose ministry is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. He convicts the world of sin, regenerates, seals, baptizes, and permanently indwells every believer at the moment of salvation, and empowers the Christian for godly living and service—without the necessity of supernatural sign gifts.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> John 16:7-15; Tit. 3:5; 1 Cor. 6:19; Eph. 1:13; Rom. 8:2,4,12,13; 1 Cor. 12:13</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>4. The Scriptures</h3>\n    <p>The Old and New Testaments are the verbally inspired and inerrant Word of God. Inspiration extends equally and fully to all parts of Scripture, so that the whole Bible, in its original manuscripts, is without error. As God’s complete revelation to mankind, it is the final authority for faith and practice.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> 2 Tim. 3:16-17</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>5. Humanity and Sin</h3>\n    <p>God created mankind in His image for His glory. However, Adam’s disobedience resulted in spiritual death, which has been transmitted to all humanity. Every person is born with a sinful nature that has neither the desire nor the ability to please God and is therefore in need of His grace.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Gen. 1:26; 2:17; 3:1-7; Rom. 3:10-18; 5:12; Eph. 2:1-7</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>6. Salvation by Grace through Faith</h3>\n    <p>God provided the remedy for sin by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, as the sacrifice for our sins. Salvation is not earned through religious deeds or good works but is received solely by personal faith in Jesus Christ. At the moment of belief, the individual is born of the Spirit and assured of eternal life in Heaven.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Rom. 5:6-9; Rom. 4:5; Eph. 2:8-9; John 3:5-18</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>7. The True Church</h3>\n    <p>The true Church, which began at Pentecost, is composed of all individuals who through faith in Jesus Christ have been united together in one body, of which He is the head.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Matt. 16:18; Acts 1:5; 2:41-42; 1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:15</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>8. The Local Church</h3>\n    <p>Each local church is a visible body of believers through which the true Church is made known to the world. God has given the local church officers and ordinances. Each local assembly is autonomous, governing its own affairs under the authority of Jesus Christ and the guidance of Scripture.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> 1 Cor. 1:2; Acts 14:23; 20:28; Heb. 13:7,17</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>9. Ordinances</h3>\n    <p>Water baptism and the Lord’s Supper are the two ordinances given to the Church. Baptism follows conversion as a public testimony of identification with Christ. The Lord’s Supper is to be observed regularly as a memorial of Christ’s death. Neither ordinance imparts salvation nor is a requirement for it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Acts 10:47-48; 1 Cor. 11:26</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>10. The Return of Christ</h3>\n    <p>Believers live in constant expectation of the imminent return of Jesus Christ—first for His saints (the Rapture), and then with His saints (His Second Coming).</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> John 14:1-3; Tit. 2:11-14; 1 Thess. 4:13-18</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>11. Resurrection and Eternal Destiny</h3>\n    <p>All people will be resurrected—believers to everlasting life in Heaven, and unbelievers to judgment and everlasting, conscious punishment in Hell.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> John 5:28-29; Rev. 20:11-15</p>\n  </article>\n\n  <article>\n    <h3>12. Christian Living</h3>\n    <p>Believers are called to love God, love one another, and love the lost. Love for God is shown through obedience to His Word. Love for one another is expressed through serving fellow believers. Love for the lost is demonstrated by befriending them and sharing the gospel both personally and through missions.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Mark 12:28-31; John 14:15; Phil. 2:1-5; Luke 19:10; Matt. 28:19-20</p>\n  </article>\n</section>"
